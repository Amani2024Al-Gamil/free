                     and rich feature arrangements may change for many websites. 
                     These changes create fluctuations in search results, based on which the SERP Checker 
                     displays a Fluctuation Graph â€” the proprietary
                     metric to help you understand search engine trends that matter
                      for your business niche.</p>

              changes in the top 30 search results in each of your target search engines, for
               any individual keyword separately or for all your keywords together. The spikes
                on your graph indicate that the real-time SERP
               changed significantly that day, implying a possible algorithm change.</p>
